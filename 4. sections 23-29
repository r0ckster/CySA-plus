Identifying Vulnerabilities

-id vuln is important so they can be mitigated

Vuln Assessment
- an evaluation of the system security and our ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration state of the system, as represented by the information collected from the system

1.collect set of target attributes
2.analyze the diff in current vs baseline configs
3.report the results


----

Scanning Workflow

Qs:
-who will conduct the scan
-when will scan be performed
-which systems will be scanned
-how will scanning impact the systems
-does system need to be isolated during scanning
-who can assist with the scanning

Example:
1.install sw and patches to establish baselined system
2.perform initial scan of target system
3.analyze assessment report based on the baseline
4.perform corrective actions based on reported findings
5.perform another vuln scan and assessment
6.document any findings and create repors for stakeholders
7.conduct ongoing scanning to ensure continual remediation

scan > patch > scan

----

Scope Considerations

Vuln Scanner
-hw appliance or sw application that is configured with a list of known weaknesses and exploits, and they can then scan for their presence in a host operating system or within a particular application

Web App Vuln Scanners (like Nikto)
-analyze applications for SQL injections, cross site scripting, and may even analyze the source code and database security to detect insecure programming practices

Infrasturcture scanners can perform mapping and enumeration in the form of a host discovery scan

Scope
-range of hosts or subnets incl within a single scan job
-important to adjust scope for efficient scan
1.schedule scans for diff portions of the scope for diff times
2.config scope based on a particular compliance objective
3.rescan scopes with crit assets more often

Internal vs External Scan
-internal, from local to local network, can be performed with permissions (credentials) to get additional detail on vulns
-external, against your network outside local, attackers POV

----

Scanner Types

Vuln scanners operate in diff modes/configs

Passive Scanning
-an enumeration or vulnerability scan that analyzes only intercepted network traffic, rather than sending probes directly towards a target
-least impact, least vuln id
-might be used if under attack for example

Active Scanning
-an enumeration or vulnerability scan that analyzes the response to probes sent to a target
-consume bandwidth and cpu
-credentialed, non-cred, server-based or agent-based scan

Credentialed Scan
-given user acco to log-on to the target
-will find more vulns and miss-configs

Non-Credentialed Scan
-sends test packets against the target without being able to log into that system or host
-can probe with default PWs
-appropriate for external assessment 

Server-based scanning 
-a vulnerability scan that's launched from one or more scanning servers against a target

Agent-Based Scanning
-is conducted using software applications that are installed locally on each target
-reduces impact on the network and service outages
-better for mobile and remote devices when offline
-agents limited to particular OSes
-agent sw could be compromised by malware

Hybrid solutions often created to use server and agent based scanning


----

Scanning Parameters

-vuln scanners must be configured with parameters to be effective and to work with segmentations and FW,IDS,IPS

1.FW must allow agent connections and server-based scan
2.IDS/IPS must allow exception for agent-based scanning

Scanning Window = disable FW for scan
- BAD IDEA
- better install scanner into each segment and report back to central management server
- or allow connections to other subnets


----

Scheduling and Constraints

-scans should be done at least weekly

When to do?
1.deployment of new or updated systems
2.id of new vulns
3.following a sec breach
4.regulatory or oversight requirement (PCI-DSS)
5.as regulary scheduled

Why not scan continuously?
-feed updates
-resources and bandwidth
-timing and costs

Data type will affect how frequently asset will be scanned

PAM - privileged access management
-used to mitigate teh risk of an inider threat
-scanner gets admin account from PAM server
-one-time PW

----

Vulnerability Feeds

-synchronized lists of data and scripts that are used to check for vulnerabilities. If using Nessus, they like to call these plugins. If you're using OpenVOS, they call them NVTs or network vulnerability tests

-many of these commercial vulnerability scanners require an ongoing paid subscription to access the feeds

-SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)
	-a NIST framework that outlines various accepted practices for automating vulnerability scanning by adhering to standards for scanning processes, results reporting and scoring, and vulnerability prioritization
	-used to uphold internal/external compliance requirements

-OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)
	-an XML schema for describing system security states and querying vulnerability reports and information

-XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format)
	-an XML schema for developing and auditing best-practice configuration checklist and rules


----

Scan Sensitivity

-amount and intensity of vulns to test against a target

-scan template, defines settings used for each vuln scan

Discovery Scan
-used to create and update an inventory of your assets and does this by conducting an enumeration of your network by mapping it out, and it finds all of the different targets without scanning for any vulnerabilities

Fast/Basic Assessment Scan
-scan that contains options for analyzing hosts for unpatched software vulnerabilities and configuration issues
-may skip some plug-ins

Full/Deep Assessment Scan
-a comprehensive scan that forces the use of more plugin types. It's going to take a lot longer to conduct this host scanning, and it has more risk of causing a service disruption
-will fully rescan every host

Compliance Scans
-based on a compliance template or a checklist, and this is going to ensure the controls and configuration settings are properly applied to a given target or host
-PCI DSS req quarterly scans!

----

Scanning Risks

-printers, VoIP phones, or embedded systems. These components can react unpredictably to any type of scanning
-scan results should be protected/encrypted
-use service accounts instead of local admins
-opening ports for scan increases networks attack surface
-static IPs minimize networks attack surface

Remediation and Mitigation

-Vulns must be prioritized and then remediated

Remediation
-overall process of reducing exposure to the effects of risk factors

Vuln reports offer recommended mitigations and fixes to security problems

Remediation is going to mitigate risk exposure down to an acceptable level based on your organizational risk appetite
-how critical is the system?
-how difficult is the remediation?
-how risky is the issue?

Change control is important part of risk mitigation

Risk Acceptance
-there is no countermeasure that's put in place because the level of risk is low enough or the risk doesn't justify the cost to mitigate the associated risk
-when risk is accepted, it should still be monitored

Vuln should be rescanned and verified after mitigation is done

----

Configuration Baselines

-settings for services and policy config for a server operating in a particular application role
-any deviation from baseline must be remediated or its risk accepted
-sec templates and baselines from vendors, 3rd parties and regulatory orgs
